Complete the tasks in this section so that you can create and register service and environment templates\. You need these to deploy environments and services with AWS Proton\.

**Note**  
We're offering AWS Proton at no additional expense\. You can create, register, and maintain service and environment templates at no charge\. You can also count on AWS Proton to self\-manage its own operations, such as storage, security, and deployment\. The only expenses that you incur while using AWS Proton are the following\.  
Costs of deploying and using AWS Cloud resources that you instructed AWS Proton to deploy and maintain for you\.
Costs of maintaining an AWS CodeStar connection to your code repository\.
Costs of maintaining an Amazon S3 bucket, if you use a bucket to provide inputs to AWS Proton\. You can avoid these costs if you switch to [Template sync configurations](ag-template-sync-configs.md) using Git repositories for your [Template bundles](ag-template-authoring.md#ag-template-bundles)\.
