# Delete templates<a name="template-delete"></a>

Templates can be deleted using the console and AWS CLI\.

You can delete a minor version of an environment template if there are no environments deployed to that version\.

You can delete a minor version of a service template if there are no service instances or pipelines deployed to that version\. Your pipeline can be deployed to a different template version than your service instance\. For example, if your service instance is updated to version 1\.1 from 1\.0 and your pipeline is still deployed to version 1\.0, you can’t delete service template 1\.0\.
